My implementation of the Space Colonization Algorithm

Basically this is a straight forward implementation of the space colonization algorithm as described here: http://www.nongnu.org/techne/research/blending/blending.pdf

I'm slowly documenting this work on my blog http://bastiaanolij.blogspot.com.au/
Currently I'm doing this all on a Macbook Pro running Mac OS X Yosemite with the latest XCode installed. That is all I've tested it on.
The GitHub repository likely runs ahead of the blog posts. 

Dependencies
=====
Besides the obvious need of having a C++ compiler and OpenGL 4 capable hardware the following 3rd party libraries are used:
- http://www.glfw.org/ 
- http://glew.sourceforge.net/
- https://github.com/nothings/stb

This repository contains those files from these libraries required to compile this on a Mac.

License
=====
I've released my code under an MIT license but in no way do I claim authorship of the space colonization algorithm nor over the used 3rd party libraries. They all have their own license that you will need to check if you wish to use any of the code provided here.
If you do find this stuff useful I'd appreciate a message and a credit somewhere.
